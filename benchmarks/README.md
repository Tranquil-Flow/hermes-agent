# Agent Memory Benchmark Suite

A comprehensive, system-agnostic benchmark for evaluating AI agent memory systems. Measures retrieval quality, temporal reasoning, contradiction handling, scope management, and advanced cognitive features across 357 scenarios in 18 categories.

## Why This Benchmark?

Most AI agent memory systems are evaluated informally — "it seems to remember things." This benchmark provides **reproducible, quantitative evaluation** across the dimensions that actually matter for agent memory:

1. **Can the system find what it stored?** (semantic recall)
2. **Does it know what's current vs outdated?** (temporal decay, contradictions)
3. **Can it handle context boundaries?** (scopes, isolation)
4. **Does it resist manipulation?** (adversarial injection)
5. **Does it scale?** (100-1000 facts, capacity stress)
6. **Can it learn from usage?** (Q-value learning, reward signals)
7. **Does it manage structured knowledge?** (typed facts, supersession)
8. **Does it work in real conversation?** (multi-turn dialogue patterns)

## Academic Foundations

The benchmark draws on established memory research:

### Cognitive Architecture (Suite A)
- **ACT-R Theory** (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998) — Base-level activation equation: `B_i = ln(Σ t_j^{-d})` models human memory accessibility as a function of recency and frequency. Our temporal_decay suite directly tests this.
  - *Anderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (1998). The Atomic Components of Thought. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.*

### Hebbian Learning (Suites A, G)
- **Hebbian Association** (Hebb, 1949) — "Neurons that fire together wire together." Our cross_reference and Q-learning suites test whether co-retrieved facts strengthen associative links.
  - *Hebb, D. O. (1949). The Organization of Behavior. Wiley.*

### Spreading Activation (Suites A, F)
- **Spreading Activation Networks** (Collins & Loftus, 1975) — Semantic memory as a network where activation spreads between related concepts. Our integration suite tests multi-step retrieval chains.
  - *Collins, A. M., & Loftus, E. F. (1975). A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing. Psychological Review, 82(6), 407–428.*

### Information Retrieval (Suites A, E)
- **BM25 Scoring** (Robertson et al., 1995) — Term-frequency based ranking. Our scale suite tests signal-to-noise discrimination.
  - *Robertson, S. E., et al. (1995). Okapi at TREC-3. NIST Special Publication.*
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (Cormack et al., 2009) — Combining multiple ranking signals. Our retrieval pipeline uses score-weighted RRF.

### Memory Consolidation (Suite B)
- **Complementary Learning Systems** (McClelland et al., 1995) — Hippocampal rapid learning + cortical slow consolidation. Our consolidation/compression suites test this two-stage model.
  - *McClelland, J. L., McNaughton, B. L., & O'Reilly, R. C. (1995). Why there are complementary learning systems. Psychological Review, 102(3), 419–457.*

### Adversarial Robustness (Suite D)

## How to Use

### 1. Implement the Interface

Your memory system must implement `BenchmarkableStore` — 7 required methods:

```python
from benchmarks.interface import BenchmarkableStore
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional

class MyMemoryBackend(BenchmarkableStore):
    
    def store(self, content: str, category: str = "factual",
              scope: str = "global", importance: float = 0.5) -> None:
        """Store a piece of information.
        
        Args:
            content: The text to remember (may include structured notation)
            category: Semantic category (factual, procedural, decision, etc.)
            scope: Context scope (global, project:X, sprint:42, etc.)
            importance: How important this fact is (0.0 to 1.0)
        """
        # Your implementation here
    
    def recall(self, query: str, top_k: int = 10,
               scope: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]:
        """Retrieve memories matching the query.
        
        Returns list of content strings, ranked by relevance (best first).
        """
        # Your implementation here
    
    def simulate_time(self, days: float) -> None:
        """Advance the simulated clock by N days.
        
        Used to test temporal decay, recency bias, and time-based features.
        Backends without time-awareness can implement as no-op.
        """
        pass
    
    def simulate_access(self, content_substring: str) -> None:
        """Simulate accessing/rehearsing a memory.
        
        Find a stored memory containing the substring and mark it as
        recently accessed. Tests rehearsal effects on retrieval ranking.
        """
        pass
    
    def consolidate(self) -> None:
        """Run a consolidation/compaction cycle.
        
        Tests whether important facts survive memory management operations.
        No-op for backends without consolidation.
        """
        pass
    
    def get_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return backend statistics (fact_count, etc.)."""
        return {}
    
    def reset(self) -> None:
        """Clear ALL stored memories. Called between benchmark scenarios."""
        # MUST clear everything — scenarios are independent
```

**Optional methods** (default implementations provided):

```python
    def reward_memory(self, memory_id: str, signal: float) -> None:
        """Apply RL reward signal to a memory. Default: no-op."""
        pass
    
    def explore(self, query: str, top_k: int = 20,
                scope: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]:
        """Multi-hop graph exploration. Default: falls back to recall()."""
        return self.recall(query, top_k=top_k, scope=scope)
```

### 2. Register Your Backend

**Option A — Direct registration:**
```python
from benchmarks.runner import register_backend
from my_module import MyMemoryBackend

register_backend("my-backend", MyMemoryBackend)
```

**Option B — Plugin file (auto-discovered):**
```python
# benchmarks/backends/my_backend.py
from my_module import MyMemoryBackend

BACKEND_NAME = "my-backend"
BACKEND_CLASS = MyMemoryBackend
```

### 3. Run Benchmarks

```bash
# Quick test (Suite A only, 1 run)
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite a --runs 1

# Full evaluation (all suites, 5 runs for statistics)
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite all --runs 5

# Specific suites
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite a,b,c,h --runs 3

# Compare against another backend
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite all --compare baseline-flat

# With LLM judge (more accurate, requires API key)
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite all --judge-model claude-3-haiku-20240307

# JSON output for programmatic use
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite all --json
```

### 4. Interpret Results

Results are printed to stdout and saved to `benchmarks/results/{backend}.json`:

```

  BENCHMARK RESULTS: my-backend
============================================================
  Runs: 5
  Overall: 0.923 ± 0.003          ← Mean ± std across runs

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Retrieval Metrics:
    Recall@1:  0.534              ← Right answer ranked #1
    Recall@5:  0.629              ← Right answer in top 5
    MRR:       0.578              ← Mean reciprocal rank
    Token F1:  0.403              ← Word overlap with gold
```

## Result Persistence & History

Results are saved to `benchmarks/results/{backend}.json` after each run. To maintain a history for regression tracking:

```bash
# Save a timestamped snapshot
cp benchmarks/results/my-backend.json \
   benchmarks/results/my-backend_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json

# Compare current vs previous
python -m benchmarks.runner --backend my-backend --suite all \
   --compare my-backend_20240115
```

The saved JSON contains per-category scores, retrieval metrics, and run metadata for reproducibility.

## Scoring Methodology

### Answer Matching

Two judge modes:

1. **Heuristic judge** (default, no API needed):
   - Exact substring match
   - Identifier match (product names, acronyms, numbers)
   - Keyword overlap with 60% threshold
   - Fast, deterministic, free

2. **LLM judge** (optional, more accurate):
   - Semantic answer equivalence via Claude/GPT
   - Handles paraphrasing, arithmetic, reasoning
   - Requires `--judge-model` flag and API key

### Retrieval Metrics

Standard IR metrics computed per-scenario and averaged:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Recall@1 | Is the correct answer ranked #1? |
| Recall@5 | Is the correct answer in the top 5? |
| MRR | Mean Reciprocal Rank — how high is the correct answer? |
| NDCG@5 | Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain |
| Token F1 | Word-level overlap between answer and gold |
| Exact Match | Exact string match |

### Statistical Comparison

When using `--compare`, the suite runs both backends with identical seeds and reports:
- Paired t-test (parametric)
- Wilcoxon signed-rank (non-parametric)
- Effect size and confidence intervals

## Reference Scores

Tested with TF-IDF embeddings (no ML model needed):

| Backend | A-F Overall | Suite H | Suite I | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| baseline-flat | 80.4% | 66.0% | 86.7% | Simple list + substring match |
| cognitive | 96.8% | 90.6% | 86.7% | ACT-R + Hebbian + Q-value |
| unified | 97.2% | 73.6%* | 86.7% | Full cognitive + structured + Ori-Mnemos |

*Suite H unified score lower due to TF-IDF limitations on notation parsing.
With sentence-transformers embeddings, unified scores significantly higher.

## Adding New Suites

1. Create `benchmarks/suite_X/fixtures/category_name.json`
2. Add a runner function: `def run_category_name(backend, scenarios, judge) -> CategoryResult`
3. Register in `CATEGORY_RUNNERS` dict
4. Follow existing fixture format conventions

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- numpy (for embeddings and metrics)
- No ML models required (TF-IDF fallback works)
- Optional: sentence-transformers, scipy (for statistical tests), anthropic/openai (for LLM judge)
